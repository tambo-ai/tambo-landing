# Tambo

> Build agents that speak your UI

Tambo is the open-source generative UI toolkit for React. Built for product engineers adding AI features to existing apps.

## What Tambo Does

Tambo lets any React app add AI features that show real UI—not just chat responses. When a user asks "show me sales by region," the agent renders an actual interactive chart, not a text summary. Register your components, and the agent picks the right one and streams the props.

It's a drop-in fullstack solution: a React SDK plus a backend that handles conversation state and agent execution. No separate agent framework required.

### Core Features

- **Your Components**: Register them once with Zod schemas. The agent renders your UI with the right props.
- **Agent Included**: No LangChain or Mastra required. Drop Tambo in and ship features, not infrastructure.
- **Streaming & Error Handling**: Real-time streaming, cancellation, error states, reconnection—already solved.
- **Agent-Native Auth**: The agent inherits your user's permissions. No separate auth layer to build.
- **MCP Support**: Full Model Context Protocol support built in.
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent message threads across interactions.
