# Tambo

> Build agents that speak your UI

Tambo is the open-source generative UI toolkit for React. Built for product engineers adding AI features to existing apps.

## What Tambo Does

Tambo lets any React app add AI features that show real UI—not just chat responses. When a user asks "show me sales by region," the agent renders an actual interactive chart, not a text summary. Register your components, and the agent picks the right one and streams the props.

It's a drop-in fullstack solution: a React SDK plus a backend that handles conversation state and agent execution. No separate agent framework required.

### Core Features

- **Your Components**: Register them once with Zod schemas. The agent renders your UI with the right props.
- **Agent Included**: No LangChain or Mastra required. Drop Tambo in and ship features, not infrastructure.
- **Streaming & Error Handling**: Real-time streaming, cancellation, error states, reconnection—already solved.
- **Agent-Native Auth**: The agent inherits your user's permissions. No separate auth layer to build.
- **MCP Support**: Full Model Context Protocol support built in.
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent message threads across interactions.

## Testimonials

> Tambo was insanely easy to get up and running—it's how you get a full chatbot from frontend to backend in minutes. I plugged it into my UI on a Friday and demoed it to my team on Monday.
> — Jean-Philippe Bergeron, Sr. Fullstack Engineer at Solink

> It's like if you gave AI your Storybook and told it could only use your design system. We already had our Zod schema, so transitioning to Tambo was a one line change that cut out so much work.
> — Richard McHorgh, AI Software Engineer at Rocket Money

> When I first started using Tambo, the components appeared exactly like we have them in our style guide and Storybook—it was the first sign of production-grade UI generation.
> — Andrew Kordampalos, Sr. Software Engineer, AI Agents at Zapier
