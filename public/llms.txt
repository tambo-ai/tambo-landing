# Tambo

> Build agents that speak your UI

Tambo is an open-source toolkit for adding AI agents to React applications. It's the missing layer between React and LLMs.

## What Tambo Does

Tambo connects your existing React components to AI agents. The agent renders your UI with the right props—no separate chat interface needed.

### Core Features

- **Generative UI**: AI agents render your React components with correct props
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming built-in
- **State Management**: Handles complex state across agent interactions
- **MCP-Native**: Full Model Context Protocol support
- **Message History**: Persistent conversation threads
- **Tool Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple tools seamlessly
- **Model Flexibility**: Works with various LLM providers
- **Agent-Native Auth**: Agents inherit user permissions

npm create tambo-app
