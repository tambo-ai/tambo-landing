**TAMBO PRIVACY NOTICE**

Last Updated: August 12, 2025

Welcome to Tambo—a react package for building AI powered applications and hosted solution for storing user messages and orchestrating LLM calls. This Privacy Notice explains how Fractal Dynamics, Inc.("Tambo") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal data in connection with the Tambo Platform (as defined in the Tambo [Terms of Use](https://tambo.co/terms)).

This Privacy Notice does not address our privacy practices relating to Tambo job applicants, employees and other employment-related individuals. Data that is not subject to applicable data protection laws (such as deidentified or publicly available information) is also out of scope.

This Privacy Notice is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations not otherwise provided by law.

### 1.&emsp;<u>Our Role in Processing Personal Data</u>

Data protection laws sometimes differentiate between "controllers" and "processors" of personal data. A "controller" determines the purposes and means (the why and how) of processing personal data. A "processor," which is sometimes referred to as a "service provider," processes personal data on behalf of a controller subject to the controller's instructions.

This Privacy Notice describes our privacy practices where we are acting as the controller of personal data. However, this Privacy Notice does not cover or address how our customers may process personal data when they use our services, or how we may process personal data on their behalf in accordance with their instructions where we are acting as their processor. As a result, we recommend referring to the privacy notice of the customer with which you have a relationship for information on how they engage processors, like us, to process personal data on their behalf. In addition, we are generally not permitted to respond to individual requests relating to personal data we process on behalf of our customers, so we recommend directing any requests to the relevant customer.

### 2.&emsp;<u>Our Collection and Use of Personal Data</u>

The categories of personal data we collect depend on how you interact with us and our services. For example, you may provide us your personal data directly when you create an account.

We also collect personal data automatically when you interact with our websites and other services and may also collect personal data from other sources and third parties.

**2.1 Personal Data Provided by Individuals**

We collect the following categories of personal data individuals provide us:

- **Contact Information**, including first and last name, email address, and communication preferences. We use this information primarily to fulfill your request or transaction, to communicate with you directly, and to send you marketing communications in accordance with your preferences.

- **Account Information**, including Account credentials or one-time passcodes, and the products or services you are interested in, purchased, or have otherwise used. We use this information primarily to administer your Account, provide you with our Platform, communicate with you regarding your Account and your use of our Platform, and for customer support purposes.

- **Payment Information**, including payment card information, billing address, usage credits, and other financial information (such as, routing and account number). Please note that we use third-party payment processing providers, including Stripe, to process payments made to us. We do not retain any personally identifiable financial information, such as payment card number, you provide these third-party payment processing providers in connection with payments. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party payment processing providers. The payment processing provider's use of your personal data is governed by their privacy notice. To view Stripe's privacy policy, please click [here](https://stripe.com/us/privacy).

- **Feedback and Support Information**, including the contents of custom messages sent through the forms, chat platforms, email addresses, or other contact information we make available to customers, as well as recordings of calls with us, where permitted by law (including through the use of automated tools provided by us or our third-party providers). We use this information primarily to investigate and respond to your inquiries, to communicate with you, and to improve our Platform.

If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the request we receive or personal data we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.

**2.2 Personal Data Automatically Collected**

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use our Platform when you engage with us. We typically collect this information through the use of a variety of our own and our third-party partners' automatic data collection technologies, including (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual's computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies. Information we collect automatically about you may be combined with other personal data we collect directly from you or receive from other sources.

We, and our third-party partners, use automatic data collection technologies to automatically collect the following data when you use our services or otherwise engage with us:

- **Information About Your Device and Network**, including the device type, manufacturer, and model, operating system, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, and unique identifiers associated with you, your device, or your network (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or advertising ID). We employ third-party technologies designed to allow us to recognize when two or more devices are likely being used by the same individual and may leverage these technologies (where permitted) to link information collected from different devices.

- **Information About the Way Individuals Use Our Services and Interact With Us**, including the site from which you came, the site to which you are going when you leave our services, how frequently you access our services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access our services from multiple devices, and other browsing behavior and actions you take on our services (such as the pages you visit, the content you view, the communications you have through our services, and the content, links and ads you interact with). We employ third-party technologies designed to allow us to collect detailed information about browsing behavior and actions that you take on our services, which may record your mouse movements, scrolling, clicks, and keystroke activity on our services and other browsing, search or purchasing behavior. These third-party technologies may also record information you enter when you interact with our products or services, or engage in chat features or other communication platforms we provide.

- **Information About Your Location**, including general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address, as well as more precise geolocation when you grant us access through your device settings. We use this information to optimize the way we route your requests to reduce latency.

All of the information collected automatically through these tools allows us to improve your customer experience. For example, we may use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our Platform, and to improve the effectiveness of our products, services, offers, advertising, communications and customer service. We may also use this information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Platform.

For information about the choices you may have in relation to our use of automatic data collection technologies, please refer to the Your Privacy Choices section below.

**2.3 Personal Data from Other Sources and Third Parties**

We may receive the same categories of personal data as described above from the following sources and other parties:

- **Single Sign-On:** We may provide you the ability to log in to our services through certain third-party accounts you maintain. When you use these single sign-on protocols to access our services, we do not receive your login credentials for the relevant third-party service. Instead, we receive tokens from the single sign-on protocol to help identify you in our system (such as by your username) and confirm you successfully authenticated through the single sign-on protocol. This information allows us to more easily provide you access to our Platform.

- **Service Providers:** Our service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as analytics and certain marketing providers, collect personal data and often share some or all of this information with us. For example, we receive personal data you may submit in response to requests for feedback to our survey providers.

- **Social Media:** When you interact with our services through other social media networks, such as when you follow us or share our content on other social networks, we may receive some information that you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network, and may include profile information, profile picture, username, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services. We use this information primarily to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of our Platform, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you messages about features that may be of interest to you.

- **Advertisers, Influencers, and Publishers:** We engage in advertising both on our services and through third-party services. Advertisers, influencers, and publishers may share personal data with us in connection with our advertising efforts. For example, we may obtain information about whether an advertisement on our services led to a successful engagement between you and a third-party advertiser.

- **Our Affiliates:** We are able to offer you the Platform we make available because of the hard work of our team members across all Tambo entities. To provide our products and facilitate our services, Tambo entities receive personal data from other Tambo entities for purposes and uses that are consistent with this Privacy Notice.

- **Other Sources:** We may also collect personal data about you from other sources, including publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions.

- **Inferences:** We may generate inferences or predictions about you and your interests and preferences based on the other personal data we collect and the interactions we have with you.

### 4.&emsp;<u>Your Privacy Choices</u>

The following privacy choices are made available to all individuals with whom we interact. You may also have additional choices regarding your personal data depending on your location or residency.

**4.1 Communication Preferences**

You can stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link provided in any of our email communications. Please note you cannot opt-out of service-related email communications (such as, account verification, transaction confirmation, or service update emails).

**4.2 Withdrawing Your Consent**

Where we have your consent for the processing of your personal data (e.g., when you opt in to receive certain types of marketing communications from us), you may withdraw your consent by following the instructions provided when your consent was requested or by contacting us as set forth in the Contact Us section below.

**4.3 Automatic Data Collection Preferences**

Where a Tambo-specific preference manager or privacy setting is not available, you may be able to utilize third-party tools and features to further restrict our use of automatic data collection technologies. For example, (i) most browsers allow you to change browser settings to limit automatic data collection technologies on websites, (ii) most email providers allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images in emails that may contain automatic data collection technologies, and (iii) many devices allow you to change your device settings to limit automatic data collection technologies for device applications. Please note that blocking automatic data collection technologies through third-party tools and features may negatively impact your experience using our services, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all. Depending on the third-party tool or feature you use, you may not be able to block all automatic data collection technologies or you may need to update your preferences on multiple devices or browsers. We do not have any control over these third-party tools and features and are not responsible if they do not function as intended.

**4.4 Targeted Advertising Preferences**

We engage third parties to help us facilitate targeted advertising designed to show you personalized ads based on predictions of your preferences and interests developed using personal data we maintain and personal data our third-party partners obtain from your activity over time and across nonaffiliated websites and other services. The data we and our third-party partners use for purposes of facilitating targeted advertising, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research, are primarily collected through the use of a variety of automatic data collection technologies, including cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help link the personal data we and our third-party partners collect to the same person, or otherwise target advertising to an individual on a third-party website or platform.

In addition to taking the steps set forth in the Automatic Data Collection Preferences section above, you may be able to further exercise control over the advertisements that you see by leveraging one or more targeted advertising opt-out programs. For example:

- **Device-Specific Opt-Out Programs:** Certain devices provide individuals the option to turn off targeted advertising for the entire device (such as Apple devices through their App Tracking Transparency framework or Android devices through their opt out of ads personalization feature). Please refer to your device manufacturer's user guides for additional information about implementing any available device-specific targeted advertising opt-outs.

- **Digital Advertising Alliance:** The [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) allows individuals to opt out of receiving online interest-based targeted advertisements from companies that participate in their program. Please follow the instructions at [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) for browser-based advertising and [https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices) for app-based advertising to opt out of targeted advertising carried out by our third-party partners and other third parties that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's self-regulatory program.

- **Network Advertising Initiative:** The [Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/) similarly allows individuals to opt out of receiving online interest-based targeted advertisements from companies that participate in their program. Please follow the instructions at [https://optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) to opt out of browser-based targeted advertising carried out by our third-party partners and other third parties that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's self-regulatory program.

- **Platform-Specific Opt-Out Programs:** Certain third-party platforms provide individuals the option to turn off targeted advertising for the entire platform (such as certain social media platforms). Please refer to your platform provider's user guides for additional information about implementing any available platform-specific targeted advertising opt-outs.

Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of these programs, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our services. Instead, it means that the online ads you do see from relevant program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, program participants may still use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your use of our services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the applicable advertising industry program.

**4.5 Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Data**

If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your personal data, you can contact us directly at [legal@tambo.co](mailto:legal@tambo.co). We may not be able to modify or delete your personal data in all circumstances.

**4.6 Partner-Specific Preferences**

Certain of our third-party providers and partners offer additional ways that you may exercise control over your personal data, or automatically impose limitations on the way we can use personal data in connection with the services they provide:

- **Device-Specific / Platform-Specific Preferences:** The device and/or platform you use to interact with us (such as your mobile device or social media provider), may provide you additional choices with regard to the data you choose to share with us. For example, many mobile devices allow you to change your device permissions to prevent our Platform from accessing certain types of information from your device (such as your contact lists or precise geolocation data), and many social media platforms allow you to change your platform permissions to prevent integrated Platform from accessing certain types of information connected with your profile. Please refer to your device or platform provider's user guides for additional information about implementing any available platform-specific targeted advertising opt-outs.

### 5.&emsp;<u>Children's Personal Data</u>

Our services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our services or otherwise provide us with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the child's parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal data from our systems. If we learn that any personal data we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal data.

### 6.&emsp;<u>Third-Party Websites and Services</u>

Our services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, applications and other services. Except where we post, link to or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to any personal data practices of third parties. To learn about the personal data practices of third parties, please visit their respective privacy notices.

### 7.&emsp;<u>Updates to This Privacy Notice</u>

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. When we make changes to this Privacy Notice, we will change the date at the beginning of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify individuals by email to their registered email address, by prominent posting on this website or our other platforms, or through other appropriate communication channels. All changes shall be effective from the date of publication unless otherwise provided.
