The future of generative user experiences is here, and we want you to help build it. **TamboHack: For Your UI Only** is a focused week-long hackathon where developers, designers, and builders come together to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-powered React frontends.

## The Mission

Tambo is an AI orchestration framework for React frontends that's changing how we think about user interfaces. Instead of static components, imagine interfaces that adapt, generate, and evolve based on user needs in real-time.

For one intensive week, you'll join the Tambo team to help shape this future. Whether you're contributing to the core platform or building innovative templates, there's **$10,000 in grants and prizes** waiting for exceptional work.

## Why This Matters

Traditional UI development is hitting its limits. Users expect interfaces that understand context, adapt to their needs, and provide intelligent assistance. Tambo bridges the gap between static React components and truly intelligent user experiences.

This hackathon isn't just about winning prizes - it's about being part of the foundational moment when AI-powered UIs become the standard. The templates you build and features you contribute will be used by thousands of developers building the next generation of applications.

## What Makes Tambo Special

Tambo isn't just another AI tool - it's a complete orchestration framework that:

- **Streams Intelligent Components:** Generate and update UI components in real-time based on user interactions
- **Maintains Context:** Keep track of user intent and application state across complex interactions
- **Integrates Seamlessly:** Works with your existing React codebase without major refactoring
- **Scales Naturally:** From simple chatbots to complex multi-step workflows
